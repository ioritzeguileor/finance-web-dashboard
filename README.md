# Finance Dashboard 

## Purpose
In order to further improve my front-end skills I chose to learn through a tutorial project in which this website was created. I learned how to use ReactJS, TailwindCSS <3, as well as Syncfusion an external UI Component Library. 

With the skills I learnt during this project I would be able to create a much more improved version of my current web-dev portfolio, which I am planning on remaking with these new skills. However before doing so I would like to work on some Back-End first so that I can later on during the Summer 2022 create a Full-Stack App most likely with the MERN Stack but I have not decided yet.

## Future Improvements

I would like to see how implementing my own data and creating a database would work in the future once I'm better at back-end, additionally I would like to add functionality to the top part of the screen which currently has non-functional cart,chat and profile. These could be made functional as well as allow me to practice implementing an authorization service.
